# introduction of python

# at the starting of learning python first we saw how to declear variable.

# first we have to understand what is variable and how it works.

# variable is a id that store value 
# every variable has their own\ different memory location 


A = 10
# here i declear A as variable for value of 10 
# now we declear some more

B = 'yashvant'
C = 10.5
D = 'pawar'

# now we print output on console screen
print(A)                                   # output :- 10
print(B)                                   # output :- yashvant
print(A , B)                               # output :- 10 yashvant

# python is case sensitive language if we change case of varible it can't perform any operation on it 

# here i declear variable of C and print c lets see error
C = "arjun"
print(c)                                   # output :- NameError: name 'c' is not defined

# now make a short program declear seprate variable on each value and print in same line and different line
first_name = 'yashvant'
middle_name = "rajendra"
last_name = 'pawar'

print(first_name , middle_name , last_name)  # output :- yashvant rajendra pawar
print('yashvant\nrajendra\npawar')           # output :- yashvant
#                                                        rajendra
#                                                        pawar

# here we saw how to assign value to a perticular varible,
# how to print a variable and perform different operation
